# Threads API

Some simple examples of how to use POSIX thread APIs.

Relevant files:
- `thread_create.c`: A simple thread creation program, with args passed to the thread.
- `thread_create_with_return_args.c`: Return values from the thread to the parent.
- `thread_create_simple_args.c`: Simpler argument/return value passing for the lazy.

Type `make` to build; each file `foo.c` generates an executable `foo` which you can then run, e.g:

```sh
prompt> ./thread_create
```

## Commond

```sh
seq 10 | xargs -i ./main-signal
```

## Homework

```sh
prompt> valgrind --tool=helgrind ./main-race

2.1. remove one of the offending lines of code?

```sh
==4054164==
==4054164==
==4054164== Use --history-level=approx or =none to gain increased speed, at
==4054164== the cost of reduced accuracy of conflicting-access information
==4054164== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```

2.2. Now add a lock around one of the updates to the shared variable,

```sh
==4065746==
==4065746==  Lock at 0x11A020 was first observed

2.3. and then around both.

```sh
==4067822==
==4067822==
==4067822== Use --history-level=approx or =none to gain increased speed, at

```
